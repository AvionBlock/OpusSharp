# OpusSharp. An unofficial .NET opus wrapper.

OpusSharp is a wrapper that allows you to directly use opus through C#.

### How it works

OpusSharp is an unofficial .NET wrapper for the Opus audio codec. It contains managed wrappers and safe handlers as well as direct native function access to the opus methods.

OpusSharp also includes prebuilt binaries available through the OpusSharp.Natives package.
